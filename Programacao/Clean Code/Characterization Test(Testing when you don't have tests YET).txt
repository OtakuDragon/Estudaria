Characterization Test(Testing when you don't have tests YET)

1. Execute the module and persist the output someway, maybe in a file.
2. Create a test that compares this output you saved to another output.
3. As you refactor keep running this test to make sure that the output
   you are getting is still the same.

This kind of testing is not safe, you could still introduce bugs and have
the output be the same, it's just something quick you can do to try to protect
yourself from breaking a module that doesn't have unit tests and you need to refactor
and add the unit tests.
