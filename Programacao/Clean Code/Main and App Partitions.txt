Main and App Partitions

Every application should be divided in two partions:

* App: Where the use cases and the bussiness rules 
       are implemented, depending on abstractions for boundaries.

* Main: Where the implementations of the abstractions used
	in the app are, also the factories, switches anything
	that depends directly on implementations.

ALL the dependencies should flow in a single direction in
the boundary between App and Main, they should go from Main
to App, App never depends on Main only on abstractions that
main implements(DIP).
