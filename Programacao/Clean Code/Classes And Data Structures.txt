Classes And Data Structures

The OO world is divided in to kinds of components:

Classes: Offer behavior and not state(tell don't ask)
	 has public methods and private attributes(no getters and setters),
	 is polymorphic wich means it's easy to add new types and difficult
	 to add behavior or change signatures.


Data Structures: Offer state and not behavior has very few non-cohesive methods and
		 public attributes(or getters and setters), is structured and may contain
		 switches, it's hard to add new types but easy to add behavior.
