Liskov Substitution Principle

A subtype should always be able to fully replace
it's parent type's behaviour, with no side effects
or unexpected behaviour.

This is a consistency principle things should do what
you expect them to do, or it becomes really hard to 
figure out where a behaviour is coming from and why.

========================================================
Indications that a subtype breaks the
Liskov Substitution Principle

* Empty implementations of methods.

* Implementations of methods that only
  throw an exception.

* Typecases(if else instanceof)
