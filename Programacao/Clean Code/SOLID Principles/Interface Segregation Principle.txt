Interface Segregation Principle

* Don't depend on what you don't need;
* Don't give more knowledge to your object than
  what it needs;
* Don't inherit methods/attributes you aren't going to use;

Breaking this principle couples your code to
code you don't need and might change and that
change will cause you to recompile.
