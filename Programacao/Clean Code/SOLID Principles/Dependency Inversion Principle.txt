Dependency Inversion Principle

"Low level policies should depend on high level policies
and not the other way around."

Low level implementation details should be treated as plugins.

Example of things that should be treated
as plugins:

* Frameworks
* Database
* UI
* Main partition
* Basicaly anything that isn't the implementation
  of the use cases of the application.

This inversion of dependency is applied by identifying
boundaries to a plugin, and turning all the source code
dependencies on that plugin into interfaces that the plugin
implements, that way both the application and the plugin 
depend on the interface.

Applying this principle cause applications to be decoupled
from frameworks, independently developable and deployable.
