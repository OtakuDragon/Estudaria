Open Closed Principle

Open for extension closed for modification

Adding new functionality shoud result in adding new coode
not in changing old code.

Basicaly depending on abstractions and adding new implementations
to those abstractions.

You can only abstratc things you know about, if a change is
required and is not part of the abstractions you will have to
change old code and change the abstractions.

Abstractions should be built iteratively, according to what
changes are requested by the clients, when you get a change
you plan to protect yourself from that change the next time
it happens with good abstractions.
